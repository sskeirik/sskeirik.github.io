    </header><p>I originally kicked off this blog around April 2022.
It&rsquo;s now February 2026 and nearly four years (a.k.a one quadrennium<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>) have passed.
How has this blog progressed?</p>
<ul>
<li>I published 3 posts (including this one).</li>
<li>I authored 9 draft posts (defined as an unpublished post over 300 words with an average/median word count of ~2000/2300 words).</li>
<li>I sketched out 9 post ideas (defined as an unpublished post with 300 words or less).</li>
</ul>
<p>If I also count unpublished draft posts, then my average post output over the past four years is 3 posts/year.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I feel proud that I have maintained some form of writing in the midst of the busy-ness of life.
On the other hand, I feel like this blog has fallen short of the dream that I had when I started it (more on that below).
Adding to my own confusion, I have been wondering lately how much of the desire to produce this blog came from trying to be somebody.</p>
<p>Let me continue on this last point for a moment.
I believe, in the last decade, two dictums took root broadly in the online tech discourse:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>You need a blog</em>.</p>
<p>Why? Because job, usually (c.f. <em>you need open-source contributions</em>) and also because professionals (and cool people) have them.
But sometimes, because you must&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Produce, don&rsquo;t consume</em>.</p>
<p>Or, in other words, via <em>building</em>, become a productive netizen and reject the vicious cycle of doom-scrolling and societal passivity that increasingly define the modern internet age.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, among tech enthusiasts, this usually means some kind of software, web page, or blog.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And so, as I began this blog, I think that these two ideas (combined with my own perfectionistic tendencies and a sizeable backlog of unpolished ideas) coalesced into this grand and grotesque vision:
a blog that would both prove my career and my mettle, resolute against the empty clamor of a vampiric social media.</p>
<p>But as time passed, that lofty vision became a burden.
Each post needed to be well-crafted <em>and</em> well-researched (and hopefully at least a little bit interesting&hellip;).
Under that pressure, writing felt like a chore rather than an opportunity and incomplete sketches began to pile up.
As the months and then years went by, at a subconscious level, I was anxious.</p>
<p>If professionals and cool people and productive netizens <em>write</em> and <em>produce</em>, what does this heap of unpublished blog posts say about <em>me</em>?</p>
<p>Writing is hard enough without FOMO and shame muddying the waters.
It requires time and discipline and passion and the courage to publish.
It may sound cliché, but I don&rsquo;t want to keep carrying the weight of trying to be that <em>guy</em> anymore.</p>
<p>To be clear, it&rsquo;s not that I wish to abandon this blog or to jettison all standards of writing or clarity of thought; far from it.
What I want is to make peace with my own writing process and to let go of unrealistic and unhelpful expectations for what is currently a minor side-project in an otherwise full life.
Put more simply: I want the <em>next</em> four years of this blog to feel a lot more free than the <em>first</em> four years.</p>
<p>When did technological output become a measure of my legacy on the same level as lasting friendships, a healthy family, and a thriving community?</p>
<p>If you (or I) write or produce, let it be because we find joy in the journey.</p>

<p>Did I know the word quadrennium before writing this post? No, I did not&mdash;I merely had a vague sense that it <em>should</em> exist based on word roots. But big words are neat, don&rsquo;tcha think?&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
