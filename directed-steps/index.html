<p>Welcome aboard my new blog <a href="srs.fyi">srs.fyi</a>! Do mind your step.</p>
<p>The purpose of this blog is two-fold, in order of importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>to record my musings and learnings;</li>
<li>to share my thoughts with others.</li>
</ol>
<p>While we&rsquo;re here, let&rsquo;s take care of some other housekeeping items:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scope:</strong> the scope of the blog includes anything that catches my interest, though I expect most posts to be technically oriented and related to my academic and professional interests.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule:</strong> the blog will have no schedule; I will write things as they come, at their own pace.</li>
<li><strong>Ads:</strong> this blog will have no ads or affiliate links (though I may link to things that I like just <em>because</em> I like them).</li>
</ul>
<p>More broadly and in no particular order, I want my corner of the web to:</p>
<ol>
<li>be a domain of my own where I can <em>create</em>;</li>
<li>be a place where I can polish and curate my thoughts;</li>
<li>have a quirky, chill, and thoughtful ambiance.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="steps-ahead">Steps Ahead</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do this blog for a long time!
Somehow, it feels like it has taken longer than it should (which is a sentiment I feel about a lot of things in life).
In the midst of that, this passage from the Bible has always been an encouragement to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A man’s heart plans his way,<br>
But the Lord directs his steps.</p>
<p>Proverbs 16:9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No matter how long you join me on this journey, I&rsquo;m glad to have you!</p>
